Back in 2019, I was introduced to mainframes, which are high-performance computers designed to process a large number of transactions in real-time. It is used by enterprises to run critical business applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility.

There are a couple of things that attract me to the platform. The first will be its long and everlasting history, dating back to the 1950s. Despite the development of modern IDEs for mainframe development, I could not keep myself off the wonderful TN3270 emulator.

In addition to the history, the scale of transaction that the machines processes are astonishing. Billions of transactions per day with up to 99.99999% availability. It is not something that can be easily replicated on your normal x86 machine.

Lastly, it is the community. I met lots of wonderful individuals who are happy to spend their time helping others and introducing new people to the field.

With all of those in mind, I decided to reimagine this site as a place where I could post mainframe materials and share them with people. After all, the mainframe world is a wonderful place, and it may very well be a place where you will find a career worth doing.
