The materials listed on this site are all provided for free. However, you will need to create an [IBMid](https://www.ibm.com/account/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to access most of them - and there are a few materials which are limited to active students from accredited institutions. Many of the IBM Learning Platform courses are also available on Coursera and/or edX. However, for both Coursera and edX, you will need to pay to obtain a certificate. All materials are self-paced unless indicated otherwise.

Do note that the links listed here are provided as-is to enhance your experience and allow you to learn more about mainframes. I am not responsible for any content on any externally linked sites. Please follow the links at your own risk.

### Introductory Materials

For someone new to the field, I would advise you to try out the IBM Z Xplore learning system. It came with access to a live z/OS machine for training, and would serve as the perfect introduction for someone new to mainframe.
