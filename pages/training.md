The materials listed on this site are all provided for free. However, you will need to create an [IBMid](https://www.ibm.com/account/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to access most of them - and there are a few materials which are limited to active students from accredited institutions. Many of the IBM Learning Platform courses are also available on Coursera and/or edX. However, for both Coursera and edX, you will need to pay to obtain a certificate. All materials are self-paced unless indicated otherwise.

Do note that the links listed here are provided as-is to enhance your experience and allow you to learn more about mainframes. I am not responsible for any content on any externally linked sites. Please follow the links at your own risk.

### Introductory Materials

For someone new to the field, I would advise you to try out the IBM Z Xplore learning system. It came with complementary access to a z/OS instance for training, and would serve as the perfect introduction for someone new to mainframe.

- [IBM Z Xplore](https://www.ibm.com/community/z/talent/get-started/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
  * Students? IBM holds [IBM zStudent Contest](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/ibm-z-student-contest-2022/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} on an annual basis, watch this space for the next one.
  * Educators? Check out the [Educator Hub](https://ibm.biz/educatorhub){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to find out more on utilizing IBM Z Xplore in your curriculum.
