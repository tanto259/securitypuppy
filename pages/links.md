When I was first introduced to the mainframes back in 2019, resources are all over the place. Back in 2021, I decided to make a list to all the beginner-friendly resources that I am familiar with to allow everyone to join the field.

Do note that the links listed here are provided as-is to enhance your experience and allow you to learn more about mainframes. I am not responsible for any content on any externally linked sites. Please follow the links at your own risk.

### Community

Community played a huge part in influencing my decision to stay in this field. I still remember being astonished seeing people with decades of experience helping and welcoming new people in the field. I hope you'll find it the same.

### Training

The mainframe field used to be associated with the absence of training resources, but those days are long gone. There are a lot of learning resources - both free and paid - which allow someone to be acquainted with the field. In fact, there are so many free learning resources that I put a dedicated page solely for them.
