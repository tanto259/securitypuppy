One thing that I realized after a while in the mainframe community is that people are open to questions. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me and I'll gladly answer them.

### Email Address

My email address is listed below. Just send me an email and I'll get back to you at my earliest convenience.

<a data="92CE2?E@oD64FC:EJAFAAJ]4@>" class="contact-button javascript-required">Please enable Javascript to see email.</a>

You can also send encrypted emails using either or both of my OpenPGP public keys. Please include your own public key if you want any replies to be encrypted.

### OpenPGP Keys

I currently have 2 separate OpenPGP keys, both of which are generated on FIPS 140-2 validated security keys. 

- [Key A: B25E CFC6 9E10 33FA](https://securitypuppy.com/.well-known/openpgpkey/B25ECFC69E1033FA.pub.asc)
- [Key B: 2FB7 7A8F 827D 7A42](https://securitypuppy.com/.well-known/openpgpkey/2FB77A8F827D7A42.pub.asc)

You can also perform a Web Key Directory lookup on the email address above to get the two keys imported.

### ActivityPub Server

I self-host a personal [GoToSocial](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} instance which allows connection to various ActivityPub-compliant app, which include Mastodon, Pleroma and Misskey. So, feel free to send me a toot and follow me!

Do note that GoToSocial is still in alpha, there might be bugs and missing features which I can't interact with.

### Snail Mail

Alternatively, snail mail is also an option. Do note that it may take a while for me to get back to you. Please include a return address for any replies.
