One thing that I realized after a while in the mainframe community is that people are open to questions. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me and I'll gladly answer them.

### Email Address

My email address is listed below. Just send me an email and I'll get back to you at my earliest convenience.

<a data="92CE2?E@oD64FC:EJAFAAJ]4@>" class="contact-button javascript-required">Please enable Javascript to see email.</a>

You can also send encrypted emails using [my OpenPGP public key](https://securitypuppy.com/.well-known/openpgpkey/EEB1D3AF8CF1C236.pub.asc) with a fingerprint of EEB1 D3AF 8CF1 C236. Please include your own public key if you want any replies to be encrypted.

### ActivityPub Server

I self-host a personal [GoToSocial](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} instance which allows connection to various ActivityPub-compliant app, which include Mastodon, Pleroma and Misskey. So, feel free to send me a toot and follow me!

Do note that GoToSocial is still in alpha, there might be bugs and missing features which I can't interact with.

### Snail Mail

Alternatively, snail mail is also an option. Do note that it may take a while for me to get back to you. Please include a return address for any replies.
